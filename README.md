# IRFDRD
Hello Everyone;

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common causes of visual loss worldwide resulting as side effects of diabetes mellitus (DM). Early detection helps in reducing the blindness. The data presented in the research illustrates the medical images of retina using fundus camera. DR dataset is categorized in to five classes: healthy, mild, moderate, sever, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy images. IRFDRD images can shows great results when used with deep learning models.

* The IRFDRD were saved in zip file with the following:

1. (healthy, mild DR) folder contains; the first class which is healthy normal fundus images in the first folder; and the second class of DR which is mild DR fundus images that is also saved in mild folder.
2. (moderate DR) folder; contain the moderate DR fundus images.
3. (sever, PDR) folder; contain subfolders, one for sever DR class and the other for PDR class.  
 
** Each class have the following number of fundus images:

Healthy         153;
Mild 	          59;
Moderate 	      304;
Sever 	         99;
PDR	            85;
*** The password for all of the folders is : 1986; 

**** I hope this  classified new dataset of DR will help the researchers in the development of advanced AI system for early DR diagnosis;  

Good Luck,
Noor.
